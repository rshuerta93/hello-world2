'Hegelian Dialectic'

They only pop back up. They should be completely wiped out, scrub the earth clean of them, and erase all history of them so they are never heard from or seen again. Seriously.
"Excepted from NEW HISTORY of the JEWS By Eustace Mullins In all of recorded history, there was only one civilization which the Jews could not destroy. Because of this, they have given it the silent treatment. Few American college graduates with a Ph.D. degree could tell you what the Byzantine Empire was.
It was the Empire of East Rome, set up by Roman leaders after the Jews had destroyed Rome. This empire functioned in Constantinople for twelve hundred years, the longest duration of any empire in the history of the world.
Throughout the history of Byzantium, as it was known, by imperial edict, no Jew was allowed to hold any post in the Empire, nor was he allowed to educate the young. The Byzantine Empire finally fell to the Turks after twelve centuries of prosperity, and the Jews have attempted to wipe out all traces of its history.
Yet its edicts against the Jews were not cruel; in fact, the Jews lived unmolested and prosperously in the empire throughout its history, but here alone the vicious cycle of host and parasite did not take place.
It was a Christian civilization, and the Jews were not able to exercise any influence. Nor did the Orthodox priests bewilder their congregations with any vicious lies about Christ being a Jew.
No wonder the Jews want to eradicate the memory of such a culture.
It was Ezra Pound who launched upon a study of Byzantine civilization, and who reminded the world of this happily non-Jewish land.
From the Byzantines, Pound derived his no-violent formula for controlling the Jews.
"The answer to the Jewish problem is simple," he said.
"Keep them out of banking, out of education, out of government."
And this is how simple it is.
There is no need to kill the Jews. In fact, every pogrom in history has played into their hands, and has in many instances been cleverly instigated by them.
Get the Jews out of banking and they cannot control the economic life of the community.
Get the Jews out of education and they can not pervert the minds of the young to their subversive doctrines.
Get the Jews out of government and they cannot betray the nation.
Through the medium of bribes, to the tune of forty millions of dollars, paid from the United States Treasury, of course, and passed out to politicians in Washington, the Jews had these men, and through them, the American people, at their mercy.
The Jews kept records of these bribes, and since that time, the
politicians have been able to refuse them nothing. Consequently,
every prominent American politician for the past fifty years is
said to have his Panama. That is to say, no American is allowed
to rise to a position of political leadership unless he has some
financial scandal, some Panama, in his background which the
Jews can use to bring him to heel at any time. For this reason,
most American politicians in the last five decades have been
classic examples of the Rags to Riches theme. Far from illustrating
the Horatio Alger legend of hard work and integrity, however,
each of these careers of sudden wealth stems from the
looting of the public till with the connivance of the Jews.
We have already pointed out that the host people, in some
five thousand years, has never been able to dislodge the Jewish
parasites through the common biological reactions of panic, anger
and violence. Because of their inability to dislodge the parasites,
in every case, the gentile community had gone down a dark road
to oblivion. The records are there for anyone to see. Despite the
falsification of history on an enormous scale, despite the burning of libraries for thousands of years, the Jews have not been able
to eradicate the records of their misdeeds. Most of the records
that have survived are now classified as "rare books", and they
are hidden away from the public in special archives. These records
are made available only to Jewish-approved scholars who
can be depended on not to reveal what they find out. Even so,
we know the history of the Jews.
We know that Babylon was a great civilization, that Babylon
became host to a sizeable Jewish community, and that Babylon
was destroyed. We know that Egypt was a great civilization,
that Egypt became host to a sizeable Jewish community, and
that Egypt was destroyed. We know that Rome was a great
civilization, that Rome became host to a sizeable Jewish community, and that Rome was destroyed. We know that England
had a great Empire, that England became host to a sizeable
Jewish community, and the British Empire vanished in a few
decades. Whether or not this is a simple coincidence which reappears throughout the history of mankind, we should remember
that the United States has a sizeable Jewish community.
